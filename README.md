**WARNING: IF YOU ARE NOT SURE ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING, THIS APPLICATION IS NOT RECOMMENDED. RUNNING THIS APPLICATION MAY RESULT IN A BAN, IF NOT USED JUST ON "NOT SUBMITTED" BEATMAPS OR PLAYING IN THE "EDIT" SECTION. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USAGE OF THIS PROGRAM.**

**IMPORTANT: This application runs even when the application is not focused.**

Simple macro that plays osu!Taiko, studying/learning purposes!

# Description
With this version (v1.0), it is a console application that activates the macro when holding CTRL, that is, if nothing is pressed, it will just read the pixel information. So you need to hold CTRL all along the beatmap.

### Observations
- More FPS = more accuracy

# Instructions are as follows:

0. Setup: You need to use an specific skin. This skin can be found in this repository as "ekumea's skin(NoBig) ver.1.02.zip".  
Why this exact skin? because that's the skin I use to play, and it fits the logic I used for making the code.

1. Open the hackdetaco.exe file.

2. Select a **NOT SUBMITTED** beatmap or go to the **EDIT SECTION** and point the cursor like that in the pause menu:
![Cursor position example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calmylake/hackdetaco/master/cursor%20position.png)

        You may put the mouse a little bit to the left and a little little bit down, like in the example image above.
        That's because you need to avoid the red X that appears if there's a miss.

3. Optional: to get better accuracy % for the macro, press SHIFT+TAB on osu!, so there's no flying notes going to the health bar. This can mess up the macro a little. But that's also something interensting to test.

4. Press ESC without moving the cursor and hold CTRL (control key).

5. You can stop the application pressing the P key.
